/*
 * NAME
 *	rename13
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *	Verify rename() return successfully and performs no other action
 *      when "old" file and "new" file link to the same file.
 *
 * ALGORITHM
 *	Setup:
 *		Setup signal handling.
 *		Create temporary directory.
 *		Pause for SIGUSR1 if option specified.
 *
 *	Test:
 *		Loop if the proper options are given.
 *                  create the "old" file
 *                  link the "new" file to the "old" file
 *                  rename the "old" to the "new" file
 *                  verify the "new" file points to the original file
 *                  verify the "old" file exists and points to
 *                         the original file
 *	Cleanup:
 *		Print errno log and/or timing stats if options given
 *		Delete the temporary directory created.
 *
 * USAGE
 *	rename13 [-c n] [-f] [-i n] [-I x] [-P x] [-t]
 *	where,  -c n : Run n copies concurrently.
 *		-f   : Turn off functionality Testing.
 *		-i n : Execute test n times.
 *		-I x : Execute test for x seconds.
 *		-P x : Pause for x seconds between iterations.
 *		-t   : Turn on syscall timing.
